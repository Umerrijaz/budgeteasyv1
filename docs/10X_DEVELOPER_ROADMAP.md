## 1. The Mountain View

Before you look at a single line of code, understand what you're standing on.

Every frontend application that has ever been built — from Facebook to a simple landing page — solves the same problem:

```
DATA  →  LOGIC  →  PIXELS ON SCREEN
```

However, as soon as you move from a *website* (like a static landing page) to a *web application* (like a SaaS dashboard), the arrow goes both ways. Modern UIs are not a one-way pipeline; they are a **continuous feedback loop**:

```
DATA  →  LOGIC  →  PIXELS  →  USER INPUT  →  DATA  →  ...
```

The user interacting with pixels is what changes the data, which rerenders the pixels. Managing that cycle without things going stale, inconsistent, or slow is where frontend complexity actually lives.

**Zero-Based Budgeting Example:**
Imagine an "Unallocated Funds" counter at the top of your app.
1. **DATA → PIXELS**: You have $500 unallocated. The screen renders `$500`.
2. **PIXELS → USER INPUT**: The user clicks an input field and allocates $100 to the "Groceries" category.
3. **USER INPUT → DATA**: The app must deduct $100 from Unallocated and add $100 to Groceries in the database.
4. **DATA → PIXELS**: The database updates, which instantly rerenders the Unallocated counter to `$400` and the Groceries counter to its new value.

That feedback loop is exactly what modern tools (like React state and Convex mutations) are designed to handle elegantly.

That's it. All of software engineering is about managing the journey from raw data to what the user sees and interacts with. The frameworks, the languages, the libraries — they are all just different vehicles for that same journey.

This codebase teaches you to see that journey clearly. Once you see it, you cannot unsee it. And once you cannot unsee it, you can build anything.

**What you are NOT learning this week:**
- Syntax to memorize
- Framework tricks
- CSS wizardry

**What you ARE learning this week:**
- Where does data live?
- How does data move?
- Who is responsible for what?
- When should something be static vs interactive?
- How do I communicate what I want to an AI so it produces correct code?

And when you add Convex to the picture, one more question:
- **How does data come alive?** (going from hardcoded → real-time, from read-only → read-write)

## 2. The Universal Mental Model — 6 Laws That Never Change

These laws apply to React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Flutter, SwiftUI, and any frontend framework that will be invented in the next 20 years. They also apply to Convex, Supabase, Firebase, or any backend you will ever use.

### Law 1: Separation of Concerns
> "Every file should have ONE reason to change."

Bad: A component that contains its own text, its own styling logic, its own API call, and its own error handling.
Good: A component that ONLY displays data it receives. The data comes from somewhere else. The styling comes from a design system. The API call lives in a separate function.

**In this codebase:** `config.tsx` owns the data. `components/` own the display. `globals.css` owns the design system. `page.tsx` owns the assembly. Four concerns, four locations.

**In Convex:** The same law scales beautifully. Your `convex/` folder owns the data layer (schema + functions). Your `components/` still own the display. Your pages still own the assembly. The only change is WHERE the data lives — the separation is identical.

```
STATIC (now):                    CONVEX (future):
├── config.tsx (data)            ├── convex/schema.ts    (data shape)
├── components/ (display)        ├── convex/functions.ts (data logic)
├── globals.css (styling)        ├── components/         (display)
└── page.tsx (assembly)          ├── globals.css         (styling)
                                 └── page.tsx            (assembly)
```

### Law 2: Data Flows Down, Events Flow Up
> "Parents tell children WHAT to display. Children tell parents WHAT HAPPENED."

This is how every component-based UI works:

```
Parent (page.tsx)
  │
  ├── passes data DOWN via props ──→ Child (Hero.tsx) displays it
  │
  └── Child fires an event UP ──→ Parent decides what to do
      (e.g., "user clicked Buy")     (e.g., navigate to checkout)
```

**In this codebase:** `page.tsx` passes `config.hero` down to `Hero.tsx`. The Hero doesn't know where the data came from. It doesn't care. It just renders.

**With Convex:** The data source changes, but the flow doesn't. A parent component calls `useQuery()` to get live data, then passes it down as props. The child still doesn't know or care whether the data came from `config.tsx` or a cloud database.

```
STATIC:  page.tsx reads config.hero          → passes to <Hero />
CONVEX:  page.tsx calls useQuery(api.hero)   → passes to <Hero />
         Hero.tsx is IDENTICAL in both cases
```

### Law 3: Single Source of Truth
> "Every piece of data should have exactly ONE owner."

If your app name appears in the header, footer, SEO title, and emails — it should be defined in ONE place and imported everywhere else.

**In this codebase:** `config.appName` is used by `Header.tsx`, `Footer.tsx`, `MobileMenu.tsx`, and `layout.tsx`. Change it once → the entire app updates.

**With Convex:** The database becomes the single source of truth for dynamic data. You don't define a budget amount in config AND the database. It lives in ONE place (the database), and every component that needs it calls `useQuery()` to read the same value.

### Law 4: Static by Default, Interactive Only When Necessary
> "Don't pay for JavaScript you don't need."

Most of your UI is static — it doesn't respond to clicks, it doesn't track state, it doesn't change after the page loads. Only make something interactive (client-side) when the user needs to interact with it.

**In this codebase:** 11 component files. Only 3 have `"use client"` (`MobileMenu.tsx`, `FeaturesAccordion.tsx`, `FAQ.tsx`). The other 8 ship zero JavaScript to the browser.

**With Convex:** Components using `useQuery()` or `useMutation()` must be `"use client"` because they need a live connection to the Convex server. But you can still keep "dumb" display components as Server Components by having a wrapper fetch the data and pass it down.

### Law 5: Contracts Before Code
> "Define the shape of your data before you write a single line of UI."

When you define a TypeScript interface, you are writing a contract: "This component REQUIRES this exact shape of data, nothing more, nothing less." This prevents bugs, enables autocomplete, and — critically — allows AI to generate correct code because it knows exactly what shape to produce.

**In this codebase:** Every component exports or imports a typed interface (`HeroProps`, `PricingTier`, `FAQItemData`, etc.). The config object is typed as `ConfigProps` which references all of them.

**With Convex:** You define contracts in TWO places:
1. **The database schema** (`convex/schema.ts`) — defines what CAN be stored
2. **The component props** (`components/*.tsx`) — defines what the UI NEEDS

These two contracts are your safety net. If the database shape doesn't match what the component expects, TypeScript catches it at build time.

### Law 6: Composition Over Complexity
> "Build small things that snap together, not big things that do everything."

Don't build a `MegaPage` component with 500 lines. Build 10 components with 50 lines each, then assemble them in your page file.

**In this codebase:** `page.tsx` is only 28 lines. It imports 8 components and assembles them. Each component is self-contained and testable in isolation.

**With Convex:** The same rule applies to your backend. Don't write one massive Convex function that does everything. Write small, focused functions: one to get budgets, one to add a transaction, one to calculate totals. Then compose them.

### The 3 Types of Components in This Codebase

| Type | Files | How It Gets Data | Why |
|------|-------|-----------------|-----|
| **Props-driven** | `Hero`, `Problem`, `FeaturesAccordion`, `Pricing`, `FAQ` | `page.tsx` passes `config.xxx` as props | The Boss decides what to show |
| **Config-importing** | `Header`, `Footer`, `MobileMenu` | Imports `config` directly | These components appear on EVERY page, not just the home page, so they read config themselves |
| **Self-contained** | `ButtonSignin`, `TestimonialsAvatars`, `CTA` | Data is hardcoded inside or uses defaults | The data is too small/specific to justify putting in config |

> **Senior insight:** There is no single "right" way. The decision depends on: _"Will this data ever need to change from outside the component?"_ If yes → config or props. If no → hardcode it.

### What Changes When Convex Arrives

A fourth type of component will emerge:

| Type | Example | How It Gets Data | Why |
|------|---------|-----------------|-----|
| **Convex-connected** | `BudgetList`, `TransactionForm` | Calls `useQuery()` / `useMutation()` directly | This component needs LIVE data from the database |

**Or** you can use the wrapper pattern to keep your display components pure:

```
Wrapper (Client — calls useQuery())
  └── passes data as props to...
      └── PureDisplay (Server — receives props, renders HTML)
```

## 4. The Data Flow — Following a Piece of Data from Birth to Screen

Let's trace the hero title from creation to pixel. This is the most important exercise in the entire roadmap.

### Flow A: Static Data (config.tsx → screen)

```
STEP 1: BIRTH — Data is defined in config.tsx
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ config.tsx                                       │
│                                                  │
│ hero: {                                          │
│   title: "The easiest way to take control..."    │  ← the data is born here
│   description: "Track expenses...",              │
│   image: { src: "...", alt: "..." }              │
│ }                                                │
└──────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                       │
                       │  import config from "@/config"
                       ▼
STEP 2: TRANSPORT — page.tsx reads config and passes it down
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ app/page.tsx                                     │
│                                                  │
│ <Hero {...config.hero} />                        │  ← spread operator unpacks
│                                                  │    the object into props:
│ // This is identical to writing:                 │    title="The easiest..."
│ // <Hero                                         │    description="Track..."
│ //   title={config.hero.title}                   │    image={config.hero.image}
│ //   description={config.hero.description}       │
│ //   image={config.hero.image}                   │
│ // />                                            │
└──────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                       │
                       │  props arrive as function arguments
                       ▼
STEP 3: DISPLAY — Hero.tsx destructures props and renders HTML
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ components/Hero.tsx                              │
│                                                  │
│ function Hero({ title, description, image }: HeroProps) {   │  ← destructure: extract
│   return (                                       │     each field by name
│     <h1>{title}</h1>                             │  ← rendered to the DOM
│   )                                              │
│ }                                                │
└──────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                       │
                       │  React converts JSX → HTML
                       ▼
STEP 4: PIXEL — The browser paints it on screen
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Browser DOM                                      │
│                                                  │
│ <h1 class="font-extrabold text-4xl ...">         │
│   The easiest way to take control of your budget │
│ </h1>                                            │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**This is the same flow in EVERY component-based frontend.** React, Vue, Svelte — all of them. The syntax differs. The flow is identical.

### Flow B: Live Data (Convex database → screen) — SIDE BY SIDE

Now watch the same journey with Convex. Notice how STEPS 3 and 4 are identical:

```
STEP 1: BIRTH — Data lives in Convex database
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Convex Dashboard / Seed Script                   │
│                                                  │
│ budgets table:                                   │
│ {                                                │
│   _id: "k17abc...",                              │  ← Convex auto-generates IDs
│   name: "June 2026",                             │
│   totalIncome: 5000,                             │  ← the data is born here
│   categories: [...]                              │
│ }                                                │
└──────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                       │
                       │  Convex server sends data over WebSocket
                       ▼
STEP 2: TRANSPORT — useQuery() fetches live data
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ app/dashboard/page.tsx (or a wrapper component)  │
│ "use client"                                     │
│                                                  │
│ const budgets = useQuery(api.budgets.list);       │  ← replaces config import
│                                                  │
│ // budgets is the SAME shape as config data      │
│ // but it's LIVE — if another tab adds a budget, │
│ // this variable updates automatically           │
│                                                  │
│ return <BudgetList items={budgets} />             │  ← same props-down pattern
└──────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                       │
                       │  props arrive as function arguments (SAME AS BEFORE)
                       ▼
STEP 3: DISPLAY — BudgetList.tsx is IDENTICAL to any static component
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ components/BudgetList.tsx                        │
│                                                  │
│ function BudgetList({ items }: BudgetListProps) { │  ← SAME destructuring
│   return items.map(budget => (                   │
│     <div key={budget._id}>{budget.name}</div>    │  ← SAME rendering
│   ))                                             │
│ }                                                │
└──────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                       │
                       │  React converts JSX → HTML (SAME AS BEFORE)
                       ▼
STEP 4: PIXEL — The browser paints it on screen (SAME AS BEFORE)
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Browser DOM                                      │
│                                                  │
│ <div>June 2026</div>                             │
│ <div>July 2026</div>                             │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The Key Difference: Convex Adds a WRITE Path

Static config is read-only. With Convex, data flows BOTH directions:

```
STATIC CONFIG (one-way):
  config.tsx ──→ component ──→ screen
  (read only, change requires editing code)

CONVEX (two-way):
  database ←──→ component ←──→ screen
     ↑              │
     │              └── useQuery() reads data DOWN
     │
     └── useMutation() writes data UP to the database
         (user clicks "Add Budget" → mutation fires → DB updates → ALL clients auto-refresh)
```

## 5. Day-by-Day Study Plan

> **Rule: Do NOT memorize syntax. Ask yourself: "Why was this decision made?"**

---

### 📅 Day 1 — The Skeleton (How Pages Are Born)
**Time: ~1.5 hours | Files: `globals.css` → `layout.tsx` → `page.tsx`**

#### File 1: `app/globals.css` (10 lines)
```css
@import "tailwindcss";

@plugin "daisyui" {
  themes: all;
}

@theme inline {
  --font-sans: var(--font-geist-sans);
  --font-mono: var(--font-geist-mono);
}
```

What's happening:
- Line 1: Activates the entire Tailwind CSS engine — every utility class (`flex`, `p-4`, `text-lg`) now works
- Lines 3-5: Plugs DaisyUI into Tailwind — every semantic class (`btn`, `card`, `navbar`) now works
- Lines 7-9: Maps the Google Fonts loaded in `layout.tsx` to CSS variables Tailwind can use

**Mental model:** This file is the power switch. Without it, no styling works. With it, the entire design system is active.

#### File 2: `app/layout.tsx` (35 lines)
The outer shell. Every page on the site is wrapped inside this layout.

Key observations:
- `data-theme="synthwave"` on `<html>` — this single attribute changes EVERY color in the app. DaisyUI maps its semantic tokens (`bg-base-100`, `text-primary`, etc.) to the active theme's palette
- `{children}` — this is where `page.tsx` gets injected. Layout wraps it
- `metadata` — SEO data (title, description) lives here, not in the HTML

#### File 3: `app/page.tsx` (28 lines — THE BOSS)
```tsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <Header />
      <main>
        <Hero {...config.hero} />
        <Problem {...config.problem} />
        <FeaturesAccordion {...config.features} />
        <Pricing tiers={config.pricing} />
        <FAQ {...config.faqs} />
        <CTA />
      </main>
      <Footer />
    </>
  );
}
```

**This is the most important file to understand.** It does three things:
1. Imports data from `config.tsx`
2. Imports components from `components/`
3. Wires data into components via props

It has ZERO logic. ZERO styling. ZERO text. That is the sign of a well-architected page.

**Questions to answer before moving to Day 2:**
- [ ] What happens if you change `data-theme="synthwave"` to `data-theme="luxury"` in `layout.tsx`?
- [ ] What does `{...config.hero}` actually do? (Hint: it's called the spread operator)
- [ ] Why does `<CTA />` have no props? (Hint: look at its default parameters)

---

### 📅 Day 2 — The Data Brain
**Time: ~2 hours | File: `config.tsx`**

Read `config.tsx` completely. This is your most important study session.

#### The Architecture of `config.tsx`

```
config.tsx
│
├── IMPORTS contracts FROM components
│   ├── PricingTier      ← defined in Pricing.tsx, imported here
│   ├── ProblemProps      ← defined in Problem.tsx, imported here
│   ├── FeaturesAccordionProps ← defined in FeaturesAccordion.tsx, imported here
│   └── FAQProps          ← defined in FAQ.tsx, imported here
│
├── DEFINES its OWN contracts
│   ├── HeroProps         ← exported so Hero.tsx can import it
│   ├── NavigationLink    ← exported so Footer.tsx can import it
│   ├── FooterColumn      ← exported so Footer.tsx can import it
│   └── ConfigProps       ← the MASTER contract (shape of the whole config)
│
└── EXPORTS the config object
    └── default export → imported by page.tsx, Header.tsx, Footer.tsx, MobileMenu.tsx
```

#### Why Some Interfaces Live in Config vs Components

| Interface lives in... | Reason |
|---|---|
| **The component** (`PricingTier` in `Pricing.tsx`) | The component OWNS that data shape. It defines what it needs. Config just satisfies the contract |
| **Config** (`HeroProps` in `config.tsx`) | The Hero component is simple enough that the contract makes more sense next to the data |

Both approaches are valid. The rule: _put the interface where it's most useful for the developer reading the code._

**Questions to answer before moving to Day 3:**
- [ ] What happens if you add a new field `buttonText: string` to `HeroProps` but forget to add it to the `hero` object? (Hint: TypeScript will scream at you)
- [ ] Why is `isPopular` marked with `?` (optional) in `PricingTier`? What does the Plus plan set it to?
- [ ] The `faqs.items[0].answer` contains JSX (`<p>...</p>`), not a plain string. How is this possible? (Hint: the type is `ReactNode`)

---

### 📅 Day 3 — Static Server Components (The Display Layer)
**Time: ~2.5 hours | Files: `ButtonSignin` → `Hero` → `Problem` → `TestimonialsAvatars` → `Footer`**

Study these in order. They go from simplest to most complex, but NONE of them have `"use client"`.

#### `ButtonSignin.tsx` — The Atom (25 lines)
The smallest possible component. One prop. One element. Notice:
- `extraStyle?: string` — the `?` means optional
- `${extraStyle ?? ""}` — `??` is the "nullish coalescing" operator. It means "use empty string if undefined"
- It's used in BOTH `Hero.tsx` and `Header.tsx` with different `extraStyle` values — same component, different appearance. **That's reusability.**

#### `Hero.tsx` — Props Destructuring (46 lines)
```tsx
function Hero({ title, description, image }: HeroProps) {
```
This destructures the props object. Instead of `props.title`, you write `title`. Same data, cleaner syntax.

Key patterns:
- `priority={true}` on `<Image>` — tells Next.js this image is above the fold, load it first (performance)
- `<TestimonialsAvatars priority={true} />` — one component rendering another. This is composition

#### `Problem.tsx` — Sub-Components + Conditional Rendering (80 lines)
The most instructive server component. Three patterns to learn:

**Pattern 1: Sub-components in the same file**
```tsx
const Arrow = ({ extraStyle }) => { ... };
const Step = ({ emoji, text }) => { ... };
export default function Problem({ ... }) { ... }
```
`Arrow` and `Step` are NOT exported. They are private helpers for `Problem`. This is like having private functions in a class.

**Pattern 2: List rendering with `.map()`**
```tsx
{steps.map((step, i) => (
  <Step key={step.id} emoji={step.emoji} text={step.text} />
))}
```
`.map()` transforms an array of data into an array of components. This is the #1 most used pattern in all of React.

**Pattern 3: Conditional rendering**
```tsx
{i < steps.length - 1 && <Arrow />}
```
"If this is NOT the last item, render an arrow." The `&&` is a short-circuit: if the left side is false, React renders nothing.

#### `TestimonialsAvatars.tsx` — Self-Contained Data (110 lines)
Notice the `avatars` array is defined INSIDE the component file, NOT in `config.tsx`. Why? Because these avatar images are a design element — a product manager would never change them from a config file. They're part of the visual design, not the content.

**Senior rule:** Not everything belongs in config. Put data in config when a non-developer might need to change it. Keep it local when it's a design decision.

#### `Footer.tsx` — Direct Config Import (97 lines)
This component imports `config` directly instead of receiving props from `page.tsx`. Why?
- The Footer appears on EVERY page of the site (home, pricing, terms, etc.)
- If it received props, EVERY page would have to pass the same footer data
- By importing config directly, it's self-sufficient

This is a **pragmatic** architectural decision. Rules exist to serve you, not the other way around.

---

### 📅 Day 4 — Interactive Client Components (Adding a Brain)
**Time: ~2 hours | Files: `MobileMenu.tsx` → `FeaturesAccordion.tsx` → `FAQ.tsx`**

Today you cross the most important line in Next.js: `"use client"`.

#### The Decision Tree (print this and tape it to your wall)

```
Does this component need to...
│
├── Remember something? (open/closed, selected tab, form input)
│   └── YES → "use client" + useState
│
├── Respond to user actions? (clicks, typing, scrolling)
│   └── YES → "use client"
│
├── Access browser APIs? (window, document, localStorage)
│   └── YES → "use client"
│
└── None of the above?
    └── Server Component — NO "use client"
```

#### `MobileMenu.tsx` — The Simplest Client Component (95 lines)

```tsx
"use client";  // ← THIS LINE changes everything

const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState<boolean>(false);
//     ↑ value   ↑ setter                  ↑ initial value
```

`useState` is React's memory. The component REMEMBERS whether the drawer is open or closed between renders.

Key patterns:
- `checked={isOpen}` — the checkbox's visual state is driven by React state (this is "controlled input")
- `onChange={(e) => setIsOpen(e.target.checked)}` — when user toggles, React state updates
- `onClick={() => setIsOpen(false)}` — every nav link closes the menu (good UX)
- `cta` prop is typed as `ReactNode` — it can receive ANY valid JSX (a button, a link, anything)

#### `FeaturesAccordion.tsx` — The Most Advanced Component (162 lines)

Two levels of state + `useRef`:

**Level 1: Parent state — which accordion item is open**
```tsx
const [featureSelected, setFeatureSelected] = useState<number>(0);
```

**Level 2: Ref — measuring the DOM for smooth animation**
```tsx
const accordion = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
// ...
style={isOpen ? { maxHeight: accordion.current?.scrollHeight } : { maxHeight: 0 }}
```

`useRef` gives you a reference to an actual DOM element. You need this to measure its pixel height for the sliding animation. This is the ONLY reason to touch the DOM directly in React.

**The lifting state up pattern:**
```tsx
// Parent defines the state
const [featureSelected, setFeatureSelected] = useState(0);

// Parent passes a setter function DOWN to the child
<Item setFeatureSelected={() => setFeatureSelected(i)} />

// Child CALLS the function when clicked — this changes the parent's state
<button onClick={() => setFeatureSelected()}> 
```
Data flows down (which item is selected). Events flow up (user clicked item 2). **Law 2 in action.**

#### `FAQ.tsx` — Each Item Owns Its Own State (102 lines)

Unlike `FeaturesAccordion` where ONE parent tracks the selection, in FAQ, EACH `FaqItem` manages its OWN open/close state independently:

```tsx
const FaqItem = ({ item }) => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);  // ← each item has its own brain
```

**Senior decision:** Why the different approach? Because FAQ items can be open simultaneously (you might want to compare two answers). Accordion items are exclusive (only one feature shown at a time). The UX requirement drives the architecture.

---

### 📅 Day 5 — The Header System + The Composition Pattern
**Time: ~1 hour | Files: `Header.tsx` + `MobileMenu.tsx` (revisited)**

The Header is the masterclass in composition: a **Server Component that contains a Client Component**.

```
Header.tsx (Server — NO "use client")
├── <Link> logo                    → Server-rendered, zero JS
├── Desktop nav links (.map())     → Server-rendered, zero JS
├── Desktop <ButtonSignin>         → Server-rendered, zero JS
└── <MobileMenu>                   → CLIENT Component, loaded with JS
    └── useState for open/close    → Only JS that ships to the browser
```

The CTA button is defined ONCE and shared:
```tsx
const cta: ReactNode = <ButtonSignin extraStyle="px-8" />;

// Used in desktop nav:
<div className="hidden lg:flex">{cta}</div>

// Passed to mobile menu:
<MobileMenu links={config.headerLinks} cta={cta} />
```

Single source of truth applied to JSX elements, not just data.

**Responsive visibility pattern (used everywhere):**
- Desktop elements: `className="hidden lg:flex"` — hidden on mobile, shown on large screens
- Mobile elements: `className="lg:hidden"` — shown on mobile, hidden on large screens
- No JavaScript involved. Pure CSS.

---

### 📅 Day 6 — Conditional Styling + The Config-Driven Pattern
**Time: ~1.5 hours | Files: `Pricing.tsx` → `CTA.tsx`**

#### `Pricing.tsx` — One Component, Multiple Visual States

```tsx
className={`card ... ${
  tier.isPopular
    ? "border-primary shadow-primary/20 lg:scale-105"
    : "border-transparent"
}`}
```

The `isPopular` boolean in config.tsx drives a completely different visual treatment. One component renders BOTH pricing cards — the "popular" card just gets extra classes.

This is the #1 pattern AI produces when you ask it to build cards, tables, or lists with varying styles.

#### `CTA.tsx` — Default Props

```tsx
export default function CTA({
  title = "Take control of your finances today",
  description = "Stop wondering where your money went...",
}: CTAProps) {
```

Default values in the function signature. If `page.tsx` doesn't pass a title, the default kicks in. This means `<CTA />` works with zero props AND `<CTA title="Custom title" />` also works. Maximum flexibility.

---

### 📅 Day 7 — The Full Picture + Convex Introduction + Simulation
**Time: 2+ hours | No new files**

#### Exercise 1: Trace 3 Complete Data Journeys
Pick any 3 sections and trace the data from `config.tsx` → `page.tsx` → component → HTML element. Write it out on paper.

#### Exercise 2: Build a New Section Without AI
Add a "How It Works" section:
1. Define an interface in a new `HowItWorks.tsx` file
2. Add the data to `config.tsx` under `ConfigProps`
3. Import and render it in `page.tsx`

If you can do this from memory (not syntax — the PROCESS), you've internalized the mental model.

#### Exercise 3: Build With AI
Ask your AI to build a Testimonials grid component. Evaluate the output against the 6 Laws.

#### Exercise 4: Convex Mental Mapping
Take 3 data items from your `config.tsx` and imagine:
- What would the Convex schema look like?
- Which ones would use `useQuery()` vs stay in config?
- Would the component need to change?

(Hint: the component almost never changes — only where the data comes from)

---

### 📅 Day 8 — Convex Fundamentals: Schema & Queries
**Time: ~2.5 hours | Focus: Understanding how Convex replaces config.tsx for dynamic data**

This is where your mental model EXPANDS. You already know:
- Data → Transport → Display
- Contracts define shapes
- Components don't care where data comes from

Now you'll learn how Convex implements this on the backend side.

#### Read Section 8 (Convex Fundamentals) of this roadmap
Study the schema definitions, query patterns, and compare them side-by-side with `config.tsx`.

**Questions to answer before moving to Day 9:**
- [ ] What's the difference between `v.string()` in Convex schema and `string` in TypeScript?
- [ ] Why does `useQuery()` return `undefined` before the data loads?
- [ ] When would you keep data in `config.tsx` vs move it to Convex?

---

### 📅 Day 9 — Convex Fundamentals: Mutations & Real-Time
**Time: ~2.5 hours | Focus: Writing data back and understanding reactivity**

#### Study mutations and actions
This is where Convex goes beyond what `config.tsx` can ever do — your UI can now WRITE data.

**Questions to answer before moving to Day 10:**
- [ ] What's the difference between a mutation and an action?
- [ ] Why do mutations automatically update all connected clients?
- [ ] What happens if you call `useMutation()` in a Server Component? (Hint: it breaks)

---

### 📅 Day 10 — Integration: Building a Feature End-to-End
**Time: 3+ hours | Build a complete Convex-powered feature**

#### Exercise: Build a Budget Tracker
1. Define the schema in `convex/schema.ts`
2. Write a query function in `convex/budgets.ts`
3. Write a mutation function for adding a budget
4. Build a display component (`BudgetList.tsx`)
5. Build a form component (`BudgetForm.tsx`)
6. Wire them together in a page

Apply ALL 6 Laws. Validate against both checklists (Section 12 + 13).

---

## 6. Server vs Client

### The Complete Decision Framework

```
START HERE
│
└── Does the component need to REMEMBER anything between renders?
    ├── NO  → Server Component ✅
    └── YES → What does it remember?
             │
             ├── Open/closed state (menu, accordion, modal)
             │   └── "use client" + useState<boolean>
             │
             ├── Selected item (tab, carousel, selected plan)
             │   └── "use client" + useState<number | string>
             │
             ├── Form input (text fields, dropdowns, checkboxes)
             │   └── "use client" + useState<string> per field
             │
             └── Data from an API (user data, live prices, notifications)
                 └── "use client" + useState + useEffect
                     (or in Convex: useQuery() which replaces both)
```

### In This Codebase

| Component | Server or Client | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `Hero.tsx` | Server | Pure display. Props in → HTML out |
| `Problem.tsx` | Server | Pure display. No interaction |
| `Pricing.tsx` | Server | Pure display. Conditional classes, but no state |
| `CTA.tsx` | Server | Pure display with default props |
| `ButtonSignin.tsx` | Server | A button element alone has no state |
| `Footer.tsx` | Server | Static links from config |
| `TestimonialsAvatars.tsx` | Server | Static display of hardcoded avatars |
| `Header.tsx` | Server | Static layout (delegates interactivity to MobileMenu) |
| `MobileMenu.tsx` | **Client** | Tracks drawer open/closed state |
| `FeaturesAccordion.tsx` | **Client** | Tracks selected feature + accordion height |
| `FAQ.tsx` | **Client** | Each item tracks its own open/closed state |

### Convex Changes the Equation

When you add Convex, a new reason for `"use client"` appears:

| Reason for "use client" | Example |
|---|---|
| Needs `useState` for UI state | MobileMenu (open/close) |
| Needs `useQuery()` for live data | BudgetList (reads from DB) |
| Needs `useMutation()` to write data | TransactionForm (writes to DB) |

**The wrapper pattern** lets you minimize client-side JavaScript:

```tsx
// ❌ BAD: The entire display component becomes "use client"
"use client";
function BudgetPage() {
  const budgets = useQuery(api.budgets.list);
  // ... 200 lines of display logic that could be server-rendered
}

// ✅ GOOD: Only the data-fetching wrapper is "use client"
// BudgetPageWrapper.tsx — "use client"
"use client";
function BudgetPageWrapper() {
  const budgets = useQuery(api.budgets.list);
  if (!budgets) return <Loading />;
  return <BudgetDisplay items={budgets} />;  // Server-compatible component
}

// BudgetDisplay.tsx — Server Component (no "use client")
function BudgetDisplay({ items }: { items: Budget[] }) {
  // Pure display, no hooks, ships zero JS
}
```

---

## 7. The TypeScript Contract System

This is your most powerful tool for AI-assisted development.

### The Pattern

```tsx
// STEP 1: Define the contract (WHAT does this component need?)
export interface PricingTier {
  id: string;            // required
  name: string;          // required
  price: string;         // required
  description: string;   // required
  features: string[];    // required — array of strings
  isPopular?: boolean;   // OPTIONAL — the ? makes it optional
}

// STEP 2: Use the contract in the component
export default function Pricing({ tiers }: { tiers: PricingTier[] }) {
//                                         ↑ expects an ARRAY of PricingTier

// STEP 3: Config satisfies the contract
pricing: [
  {
    id: "plus",           // ✅ string
    name: "Plus",         // ✅ string
    price: "$19",         // ✅ string
    description: "...",   // ✅ string
    features: ["..."],    // ✅ string[]
    // isPopular omitted  // ✅ because it's optional (?)
  },
  {
    id: "pro",
    name: "Pro",
    price: "$49",
    description: "...",
    features: ["..."],
    isPopular: true,      // ✅ boolean — triggers special styling
  },
]
```

### Why AI Loves This

When you tell an AI: _"Build a component that accepts `PricingTier[]`"_, the AI knows EXACTLY:
- What fields exist
- What types they are
- Which are optional
- How to loop through the array

Without the contract, the AI guesses. With the contract, the AI is precise.

### Contracts in Convex — The Same Idea, Different Syntax

In Convex, you define contracts in `schema.ts` using `v.` validators instead of TypeScript types:

```
TypeScript Interface            Convex Schema
─────────────────────           ──────────────────────
interface Budget {              defineTable({
  name: string;                   name: v.string(),
  totalIncome: number;            totalIncome: v.number(),
  isActive?: boolean;             isActive: v.optional(v.boolean()),
  categories: string[];           categories: v.array(v.string()),
}                               })
```

**The concept is identical.** Both say: "This is the shape of the data." The TypeScript version enforces it at compile time. The Convex version enforces it at runtime (the database will REJECT data that doesn't match).

---

## 8. Convex Fundamentals — The Backend Brain

This section teaches you Convex from scratch, the same way Sections 1-7 taught you the frontend. Same approach: **mental models first, syntax second.**

### 8.1 What IS Convex?

Convex is a **reactive backend-as-a-service**. Let's unpack each word:

| Word | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Backend** | It stores your data, runs your server-side logic, handles auth — everything that doesn't happen in the browser |
| **As-a-service** | You don't set up a server. No Docker, no AWS, no database configuration. Convex runs it all for you |
| **Reactive** | When data changes, every client seeing that data updates AUTOMATICALLY. No polling, no refresh buttons, no WebSocket code |

```
Traditional Backend:
  Browser → sends HTTP request → Server processes → sends response back → Browser shows it
  (User must refresh to see updates from other users)

Convex:
  Browser ←──── live WebSocket connection ────→ Convex
  (Data updates appear INSTANTLY across all connected clients)
```

### 8.2 The Convex File Structure

```
convex/                          ← ALL backend code lives here
│
├── _generated/                  ← AUTO-GENERATED. Never edit these files!
│   ├── api.d.ts                 ← Type-safe references to YOUR functions
│   ├── server.d.ts              ← Types for query/mutation/action helpers
│   └── dataModel.d.ts           ← Types derived from YOUR schema
│
├── schema.ts                    ← THE DATA CONTRACT (like config.tsx for the DB)
│   └── Defines every table and its field types
│
├── budgets.ts                   ← FUNCTIONS for the budgets table
│   ├── query: list              ← "Give me all budgets"
│   ├── query: getById           ← "Give me one specific budget"
│   └── mutation: create         ← "Add a new budget"
│
├── transactions.ts              ← FUNCTIONS for the transactions table
│   ├── query: listByBudget      ← "Give me all transactions for budget X"
│   └── mutation: add            ← "Record a new transaction"
│
└── categories.ts                ← FUNCTIONS for categories
    ├── query: list
    └── mutation: create
```

**Mental model:** The `convex/` folder IS your backend. `schema.ts` is the shape. The other files are the behavior.

### 8.3 Schema — Your Database's Config.tsx

In your current app, `config.tsx` defines the shape of all data. In Convex, `schema.ts` does the same thing for the database.

#### Side-by-Side: config.tsx vs convex/schema.ts

```tsx
// ──────────────────────────────────────────────
// CONFIG.TSX (what you have NOW)
// ──────────────────────────────────────────────

export interface PricingTier {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  price: string;
  description: string;
  features: string[];
  isPopular?: boolean;
}

const config = {
  pricing: [
    { id: "plus", name: "Plus", price: "$19", ... },
    { id: "pro", name: "Pro", price: "$49", ... },
  ]
};


// ──────────────────────────────────────────────
// CONVEX/SCHEMA.TS (what you'll have with Convex)
// ──────────────────────────────────────────────

import { defineSchema, defineTable } from "convex/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

export default defineSchema({
  pricing: defineTable({
    name: v.string(),
    price: v.string(),
    description: v.string(),
    features: v.array(v.string()),
    isPopular: v.optional(v.boolean()),
  }),
});
```

#### The Validator System (`v.xxx`)

Convex uses validators instead of TypeScript types to define what can be stored in the database. They look different but serve the exact same purpose.

```
TypeScript Type        Convex Validator            What It Means
─────────────          ──────────────              ────────────────
string                 v.string()                  A text value
number                 v.number()                  A numeric value
boolean                v.boolean()                 true or false
string[]               v.array(v.string())         A list of text values
number | null          v.union(v.number(),          A number OR null
                         v.null())
optional?: string      v.optional(v.string())      The field can be omitted
any                    v.any()                     ❌ DON'T USE — same as TypeScript's `any`
```

**Advanced validators you'll need for BudgetEasy:**

```tsx
// Nested objects (like a category within a budget)
v.object({
  name: v.string(),
  allocated: v.number(),
  spent: v.number(),
})

// Array of objects (like a list of categories)
v.array(v.object({
  name: v.string(),
  allocated: v.number(),
}))

// Union types (a transaction can be "income" or "expense")
v.union(v.literal("income"), v.literal("expense"))

// Reference to another table (like a foreign key)
v.id("budgets")  // ← references a row in the "budgets" table
```

#### Full Example: BudgetEasy Schema

```tsx
// convex/schema.ts
import { defineSchema, defineTable } from "convex/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

export default defineSchema({
  // Each table is like a section in config.tsx
  budgets: defineTable({
    name: v.string(),                    // "June 2026"
    totalIncome: v.number(),             // 5000
    createdAt: v.number(),               // timestamp
    userId: v.string(),                  // who owns this budget
  }),

  categories: defineTable({
    budgetId: v.id("budgets"),           // ← links to a specific budget
    name: v.string(),                    // "Groceries"
    allocated: v.number(),               // 400 (how much budgeted)
    color: v.optional(v.string()),       // "#4CAF50" for UI display
  }),

  transactions: defineTable({
    budgetId: v.id("budgets"),           // ← links to a budget
    categoryId: v.id("categories"),      // ← links to a category
    amount: v.number(),                  // 42.50
    description: v.string(),            // "Trader Joe's groceries"
    type: v.union(                       // "income" or "expense"
      v.literal("income"),
      v.literal("expense")
    ),
    date: v.number(),                    // timestamp
  }),
});
```

**Compare this to how you'd define the same data in config.tsx:**

```tsx
// If this lived in config.tsx (static, hardcoded):
interface Budget {
  name: string;
  totalIncome: number;
  createdAt: number;
  userId: string;
}

interface Category {
  budgetId: string;      // In config, this would just be a string
  name: string;
  allocated: number;
  color?: string;
}

// The SHAPES are nearly identical. The difference:
// - config.tsx: data is hardcoded, read-only, same for all users
// - schema.ts: data is live, read-write, unique per user
```

### 8.4 Queries — Reading Data (The Convex version of importing config)

A query is a function that READS data from the database. It's the Convex equivalent of `import config from "@/config"`.

#### Side-by-Side: Config Import vs Convex Query

```tsx
// ──────────────────────────────────────────────
// STATIC (what you do NOW)
// ──────────────────────────────────────────────

// In page.tsx:
import config from "@/config";
// config.pricing is immediately available
// It NEVER changes unless you edit the file


// ──────────────────────────────────────────────
// CONVEX (what you'll do with Convex)
// ──────────────────────────────────────────────

// STEP 1: Define the query (convex/transactions.ts)
import { query } from "./_generated/server";

export const listRecent = query({
  // No arguments needed — just "give me everything"
  args: {},
  // The handler runs on the Convex server, NOT in the browser
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    return await ctx.db.query("transactions").order("desc").take(50);
    //          ↑ ctx.db is the database connection
    //                    ↑ .query("transactions") = "look in the table"
    //                                              ↑ .order().take() = "get latest 50"
  },
});

// STEP 2: Use it in a component
"use client";
import { useQuery } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "../convex/_generated/api";

function TransactionList() {
  const transactions = useQuery(api.transactions.listRecent);
  //                       ↑ type-safe reference to the query you defined
  //    ↑ transactions is undefined while loading, then becomes an array

  if (!transactions) return <div>Loading...</div>;  // ← handle the loading state

  return transactions.map(tx => (
    <div key={tx._id}>{tx.description} - ${tx.amount}</div>
  ));
}
```

#### Query Patterns You'll Use in BudgetEasy

```tsx
// Pattern 1: Get all items
export const listAll = query({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    return await ctx.db.query("transactions").collect();
  },
});

// Pattern 2: Get one item by ID
export const getById = query({
  args: { transactionId: v.id("transactions") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    return await ctx.db.get("transactions", args.transactionId);
    //                  ↑ .get(tableName, id) returns a single document
    //                    Always pass the table name first (current Convex API)
  },
});

// Pattern 3: Filter items
// ⚠️ AVOID .filter() on the database — it scans every row.
// Prefer .withIndex() (see Section 8.8). Shown here ONLY to contrast.
export const listByBudget = query({
  args: { budgetId: v.id("budgets") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    return await ctx.db
      .query("transactions")
      .withIndex("by_budget", (q) => q.eq("budgetId", args.budgetId))
      //         ↑ uses an index — fast lookup (define it in schema.ts)
      .collect();
  },
});

// Pattern 4: Get items with ordering
export const listRecent = query({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    return await ctx.db
      .query("transactions")
      .order("desc")           // ← newest first
      .take(10);               // ← only get 10
  },
});

// Pattern 5: Get related data (join-like)
export const getWithCategory = query({
  args: { transactionId: v.id("transactions") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const tx = await ctx.db.get("transactions", args.transactionId);
    if (!tx) return null;
    const category = await ctx.db.get("categories", tx.categoryId);
    return { ...tx, category };
    //     ↑ combine transaction + its category into one object
  },
});
```

### 8.5 Mutations — Writing Data (What config.tsx Can Never Do)

A mutation is a function that WRITES data to the database. This is where Convex goes beyond `config.tsx`. Config is read-only. Mutations let the UI change data.

```tsx
// convex/transactions.ts
import { mutation } from "./_generated/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

// CREATE a new transaction
export const add = mutation({
  // Define EXACTLY what arguments this mutation accepts (the contract!)
  args: {
    budgetId: v.id("budgets"),
    categoryId: v.id("categories"),
    amount: v.number(),
    description: v.string(),
    type: v.union(v.literal("income"), v.literal("expense")),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Insert a new row into the transactions table
    const transactionId = await ctx.db.insert("transactions", {
      budgetId: args.budgetId,
      categoryId: args.categoryId,
      amount: args.amount,
      description: args.description,
      type: args.type,
      date: Date.now(),
    });
    return transactionId;  // ← returns the new document's ID
  },
});

// UPDATE an existing transaction
export const updateAmount = mutation({
  args: {
    transactionId: v.id("transactions"),
    newAmount: v.number(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    await ctx.db.patch("transactions", args.transactionId, {
      amount: args.newAmount,
    });
    // .patch(tableName, id, fields) updates ONLY the fields you specify
    // .replace(tableName, id, doc) would overwrite the ENTIRE document
  },
});

// DELETE a transaction
export const remove = mutation({
  args: { transactionId: v.id("transactions") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    await ctx.db.delete("transactions", args.transactionId);
  },
});
```

#### Using Mutations in Components

```tsx
"use client";
import { useMutation } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "../convex/_generated/api";
import { useState } from "react";
import { Id } from "../convex/_generated/dataModel";

function AddTransactionForm({ 
  budgetId, 
  categoryId 
}: { 
  budgetId: Id<"budgets">; 
  categoryId: Id<"categories">; 
}) {
  const [description, setDescription] = useState("");
  const [amount, setAmount] = useState("");
  
  // useMutation returns a function you can call
  const addTransaction = useMutation(api.transactions.add);
  
  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    
    await addTransaction({
      budgetId,
      categoryId,
      description,
      amount: parseFloat(amount),
      type: "expense",
    });
    
    // After the mutation succeeds:
    // 1. The database is updated
    // 2. ALL useQuery() calls watching "transactions" auto-refresh
    // 3. Every connected client sees the new transaction instantly
    // 4. You don't need to manually refresh or invalidate anything
    
    setDescription("");
    setAmount("");
  };
  
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input 
        placeholder="Description"
        value={description} 
        onChange={(e) => setDescription(e.target.value)} 
      />
      <input 
        placeholder="Amount"
        value={amount} 
        onChange={(e) => setAmount(e.target.value)} 
      />
      <button type="submit" className="btn btn-primary">Add Transaction</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

### 8.6 Actions — When You Need the Outside World

Actions are for things that go BEYOND the database: calling external APIs, sending emails, processing payments. They're less common but important to understand.

```
query     → READ from database     (pure, cacheable, fast)
mutation  → WRITE to database      (pure, transactional, auto-syncs)
action    → TALK to outside world  (can call APIs, send emails, etc.)
```

```tsx
// convex/notifications.ts
"use node";  // ← required when the action uses Node APIs / SDKs
import { action } from "./_generated/server";
import { internal } from "./_generated/api";
import { v } from "convex/values";

export const sendBudgetAlert = action({
  args: { userId: v.string(), message: v.string() },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Actions CAN call external APIs
    await fetch("https://api.email-service.com/send", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify({
        to: args.userId,
        message: args.message,
      }),
    });
    
    // Actions reach the database by calling a query/mutation — never ctx.db.
    // ALWAYS call internal.* (never api.*) from server code: internal functions
    // cannot be invoked by clients, so they skip the public auth/validation contract.
    await ctx.runMutation(internal.notifications.markSent, {
      userId: args.userId,
    });
  },
});
```

**When to use each:**

| Use | When | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Query** | Reading data to display | "Show me all my budgets" |
| **Mutation** | Creating, updating, or deleting data | "Add a new transaction" |
| **Action** | Calling external services | "Send an email when budget exceeds limit" |

### 8.7 The Convex Provider — Wiring It All Together

Before any `useQuery` or `useMutation` works, your app needs a `ConvexProvider` wrapping the component tree. This is like how `layout.tsx` wraps all pages.

```tsx
// app/ConvexClientProvider.tsx
"use client";
import { ConvexProvider, ConvexReactClient } from "convex/react";
import { ReactNode } from "react";

const convex = new ConvexReactClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL!);
//                                   ↑ The URL of your Convex deployment
//                                     Set this in .env.local

export default function ConvexClientProvider({ 
  children 
}: { 
  children: ReactNode 
}) {
  return (
    <ConvexProvider client={convex}>
      {children}
    </ConvexProvider>
  );
}
```

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx — wrap your app with the provider
import ConvexClientProvider from "./ConvexClientProvider";

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html data-theme="synthwave">
      <body>
        <ConvexClientProvider>
          {children}        {/* ← now every page can use useQuery/useMutation */}
        </ConvexClientProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

**Mental model:** `ConvexProvider` is like plugging in the WiFi router. Without it, no component can talk to the database. With it, every component inside the tree can read and write data.

### 8.8 Indexes — Making Queries Fast

When your database grows, you need indexes to keep queries fast. Think of them like the index at the back of a textbook — instead of reading every page, you jump directly to what you need.

```tsx
// convex/schema.ts
export default defineSchema({
  transactions: defineTable({
    budgetId: v.id("budgets"),
    categoryId: v.id("categories"),
    amount: v.number(),
    date: v.number(),
    type: v.union(v.literal("income"), v.literal("expense")),
  })
    // Indexes go AFTER the table definition
    .index("by_budget", ["budgetId"])           // ← fast lookup by budget
    .index("by_category", ["categoryId"])       // ← fast lookup by category
    .index("by_budget_and_date", ["budgetId", "date"]),  // ← fast lookup + sorting
});
```

Using an index in a query:

```tsx
// WITHOUT index (scans every row — slow for large tables)
export const listByBudget = query({
  args: { budgetId: v.id("budgets") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    return await ctx.db
      .query("transactions")
      .filter((q) => q.eq(q.field("budgetId"), args.budgetId))
      .collect();
  },
});

// WITH index (jumps directly to matching rows — fast)
export const listByBudget = query({
  args: { budgetId: v.id("budgets") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    return await ctx.db
      .query("transactions")
      .withIndex("by_budget", (q) => q.eq("budgetId", args.budgetId))
      //         ↑ use the index we defined in schema.ts
      .collect();
  },
});
```

**Rule of thumb:** If you're filtering by a field in a query, that field should have an index.

### 8.9 Real-Time Reactivity — The Killer Feature

This is what makes Convex fundamentally different from REST APIs. **You never manually refresh data.**

```
REST API approach (without Convex):
  1. Component mounts → fetch data → display
  2. Another user adds a transaction
  3. Your screen is STALE — you're looking at old data
  4. You must manually poll or refresh to see updates

Convex approach:
  1. Component mounts → useQuery() subscribes → display
  2. Another user adds a transaction
  3. Convex server pushes the update through WebSocket
  4. useQuery() automatically re-renders your component
  5. Your screen is ALWAYS up to date
```

```tsx
// This component will ALWAYS show the latest data
// Even if another user (or another browser tab) adds a transaction
function TransactionList() {
  const transactions = useQuery(api.transactions.listRecent);
  // ^^ This is not a one-time fetch. It's a SUBSCRIPTION.
  // It re-runs every time the "transactions" table changes.
  
  // You don't need:
  // ❌ useEffect(() => { fetch(...) }, [])
  // ❌ setInterval to poll for updates
  // ❌ manual cache invalidation
  // ❌ WebSocket setup code
  
  if (!transactions) return <Loading />;
  return transactions.map(tx => <TransactionRow key={tx._id} transaction={tx} />);
}
```

### 8.10 The Two Non-Negotiables — Auth + Validators

Every example above was simplified to teach ONE concept at a time. In a real multi-user app like BudgetEasy, **every public query and mutation needs two more things** before you ship. Convex's own best-practices docs list both as required.

#### Non-Negotiable 1: Validate arguments AND the return value

You already saw `args:` validators. The matching half is `returns:` — it locks down the shape your function hands back, so the database can never leak a field you didn't intend.

```tsx
import { query } from "./_generated/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

export const getBudget = query({
  args: { budgetId: v.id("budgets") },
  returns: v.union(                       // ← define the OUTPUT shape too
    v.object({
      _id: v.id("budgets"),
      _creationTime: v.number(),
      name: v.string(),
      totalIncome: v.number(),
      userId: v.string(),
    }),
    v.null(),                             // .get() can return null — say so
  ),
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    return await ctx.db.get("budgets", args.budgetId);
  },
});
```

**Rule:** `args` protects the way IN, `returns` protects the way OUT. Public functions need both.

#### Non-Negotiable 2: Check auth + ownership in EVERY public function

A Convex function is a public API endpoint. Anyone who knows the function name can call it with any ID. So you must verify (a) the user is signed in, and (b) the data they're touching actually belongs to them. Never trust an ID coming from the client.

```tsx
// convex/budgets.ts
export const getById = query({
  args: { budgetId: v.id("budgets") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // (a) Is the user signed in? ctx.auth cannot be spoofed by the client.
    const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    if (!identity) throw new Error("Not authenticated");

    const budget = await ctx.db.get("budgets", args.budgetId);

    // (b) Does this budget belong to THIS user? Never use a spoofable
    //     field (like email) for this check — use identity.subject.
    if (!budget || budget.userId !== identity.subject) {
      throw new Error("Not found"); // don't leak whether the ID exists
    }

    return budget;
  },
});
```

**Senior pattern — write the check once.** Repeating these eight lines in 30 functions is a recipe for forgetting one. Wrap `query`/`mutation` with a custom function (via `convex-helpers`) so `ctx.user` is always present, or extract a `getCurrentUser(ctx)` / `loadOwnedBudget(ctx, id)` helper and call it at the top of every function. (See the Convex rules in this repo for the full custom-function pattern.)

```tsx
// convex/lib/auth.ts — the helper every function reuses
export async function getCurrentUser(ctx: QueryCtx | MutationCtx) {
  const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
  if (!identity) throw new Error("Not authenticated");
  return identity; // identity.subject is the unguessable user id
}
```

> **Add this to your `CONTEXT.md`:** "Every public Convex function must (1) validate `args` and `returns`, and (2) call `getCurrentUser(ctx)` and verify ownership before reading or writing."

---

## 9. The Bridge to Convex — Where the Config Pattern Evolves

Right now, `config.tsx` is a **static** single source of truth. The data is hardcoded in a file. When you move to Convex, the single source of truth becomes a **live database**, but the mental model is IDENTICAL.

### What Changes, What Stays

| Concept | BudgetEasy (now) | BudgetEasy + Convex (future) |
|---|---|---|
| **Where data lives** | `config.tsx` (a file) | Convex database (a cloud) |
| **How data moves to components** | Props from `page.tsx` | `useQuery()` hook from Convex |
| **How data is written** | Edit the file manually | `useMutation()` from the UI |
| **TypeScript contracts** | Same | Same (Convex uses your schema for types) |
| **Server vs Client** | Same decision tree | Same, but components using `useQuery()` must be `"use client"` |
| **Component structure** | Same | Same |
| **One job per component** | Same | Same |
| **Separation of concerns** | Same | Same |
| **Real-time updates** | ❌ Not possible | ✅ Automatic |

### The Evolution in Code

```tsx
// ──────────────────────────────────────────────
// TODAY (Static Landing Page):
// ──────────────────────────────────────────────

// config.tsx
const config = {
  pricing: [
    { id: "plus", name: "Plus", price: "$19", ... },
  ]
};

// page.tsx
import config from "@/config";
<Pricing tiers={config.pricing} />

// Pricing.tsx — a SERVER Component
function Pricing({ tiers }: { tiers: PricingTier[] }) {
  return tiers.map(tier => <PriceCard key={tier.id} {...tier} />);
}


// ──────────────────────────────────────────────
// TOMORROW (Convex-Powered SaaS):
// ──────────────────────────────────────────────

// convex/pricing.ts
export const list = query({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    return await ctx.db.query("pricing").collect();
  },
});

// PricingWrapper.tsx — a CLIENT Component (handles data fetching)
"use client";
function PricingWrapper() {
  const tiers = useQuery(api.pricing.list);
  if (!tiers) return <Loading />;
  return <Pricing tiers={tiers} />;
}

// Pricing.tsx — UNCHANGED. Still a SERVER-compatible Component
function Pricing({ tiers }: { tiers: PricingTier[] }) {
  return tiers.map(tier => <PriceCard key={tier.id} {...tier} />);
}
```

**The component `Pricing.tsx` doesn't change at all.** It still receives a `PricingTier[]` and renders it. It doesn't care if the data came from a hardcoded file or a live database. **That's the power of separation of concerns.**

### What Convex Adds to Your Mental Model

```
CURRENT MENTAL MODEL:
  Data (config.tsx) → Transport (props) → Display (component)

CONVEX MENTAL MODEL:
  Data (database) → Transport (useQuery/useMutation) → Display (component)
                   → Mutations (useMutation) change data → database auto-syncs
```

New concepts you've learned in this roadmap:
- **`useQuery()`** — replaces reading from config. Returns live data that auto-updates
- **`useMutation()`** — lets the UI WRITE data back (like a user saving a budget)
- **`action()`** — for external API calls (email, payments, etc.)
- **Schema definitions** — similar to your TypeScript interfaces, but they define the database structure
- **Indexes** — make queries fast by pre-organizing data
- **Real-time reactivity** — when data changes in the DB, every connected client auto-updates. No refresh needed

But the 6 Laws still apply. Data still flows down. Components still have one job. Contracts still define shapes. You just swap the data source.

### What Stays in config.tsx vs What Moves to Convex

Not everything should move to the database. Here's the decision framework:

| Data | Keep in config.tsx | Move to Convex | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| App name, logo | ✅ | | Changes once a year, if ever |
| Navigation links | ✅ | | Same for all users, rarely changes |
| SEO metadata | ✅ | | Static, per-page |
| Hero text/images | ✅ | | Marketing copy, changes infrequently |
| Pricing tiers | Maybe | Maybe | Depends: static marketing page = config. Dynamic pricing = Convex |
| User budgets | | ✅ | Different per user, changes constantly |
| Transactions | | ✅ | Created by users, queried and filtered |
| Categories | | ✅ | Users customize them |
| User preferences | | ✅ | Theme, currency, display settings |

**Rule:** If a non-developer edits it monthly or less → `config.tsx`. If a user changes it in the app → Convex.

## 11. The AI Context Wall — How to Survive Week 3

The biggest trap solo developers fall into with AI: **Day one, your AI knows everything. Week three, it forgets.**

As your codebase grows, the AI loses the plot. It starts suggesting patterns you abandoned days ago. It forgets your tech stack. It overwrites your customized UI components with generic code. 

**The Fix:** Keep a single `CONTEXT.md` file in the root of your project. 

Paste the contents of this file at the start of *every single AI session* (or set it as a permanent instruction if your AI tool supports it). It should be short and evolve as you build. It acts as the permanent memory for your AI assistant.

### Example `CONTEXT.md`

```markdown
# Project Context: BudgetEasy
- **Stack:** Next.js (App Router), React, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, Convex.
- **Styling Rules:** Use semantic DaisyUI tokens (`bg-base-100`, `text-primary`) only. Never use hardcoded Tailwind hex colors.
- **Architecture:** We follow strict Separation of Concerns. UI components (in `/components`) should be "dumb" and receive data via props. 
- **Data Flow:** All static data originates from `config.tsx`. When building Convex queries, wrapper components fetch data and pass it down as props.
- **Server/Client:** Default to Server Components. Only use `"use client"` when state (`useState`), browser APIs, or interactivity is explicitly required.
- **Convex Rules:** All database functions live in `convex/`. Queries are pure reads. Mutations are pure writes. Actions are for external APIs only. Always define indexes for filtered queries.
```

If you do this, your AI will code like a Senior Dev on Week 3, not a confused intern.

## 12. Next.js Best Practices Checklist

Use this as a quick reference when building or reviewing AI-generated code.

### Architecture
- [ ] Pages are thin — they import and assemble, nothing more
- [ ] Layout wraps all pages with shared shell (fonts, theme, metadata)
- [ ] Components are self-contained — each one can be understood in isolation
- [ ] Data lives in config or a database, NOT hardcoded in components

### Performance
- [ ] Server Components by default — `"use client"` only when state or interactivity is required
- [ ] `priority={true}` on above-the-fold images
- [ ] Next.js `<Image>` instead of plain `<img>` (automatic optimization)
- [ ] Next.js `<Link>` instead of plain `<a>` for internal links (client-side navigation)

### TypeScript
- [ ] Every component has a typed props interface
- [ ] Interfaces are exported when other files need them
- [ ] Use `?` for optional fields, never pass `undefined` manually
- [ ] Config object is typed with a master interface

### Styling (Tailwind + DaisyUI)
- [ ] Use semantic DaisyUI tokens (`bg-base-100`, `text-primary`) instead of raw colors (`bg-blue-600`)
- [ ] Theme is set via `data-theme` on `<html>`, never hardcoded
- [ ] Responsive design uses Tailwind breakpoints (`md:`, `lg:`) not media queries
- [ ] Opacity uses Tailwind syntax (`text-base-content/80` = 80% opacity)

### SEO
- [ ] One `<h1>` per page (in the Hero)
- [ ] Heading hierarchy is correct (`h1` → `h2` → `h3`)
- [ ] `metadata` is exported from layout or page files
- [ ] All images have descriptive `alt` text
- [ ] All links have descriptive `title` attributes

---

## 13. Convex Best Practices Checklist

Use this alongside the Next.js checklist when building database-powered features.

### Schema
- [ ] Every table is defined in `convex/schema.ts`
- [ ] Field types use `v.` validators (never raw TypeScript types in schema)
- [ ] Optional fields use `v.optional()` (not `?`)
- [ ] References between tables use `v.id("tableName")` (not plain strings)
- [ ] Indexes are defined for every field you filter on — prefer `.withIndex()` over `.filter()`
- [ ] No redundant indexes (`by_a` is unnecessary if you have `by_a_and_b`)

### Queries
- [ ] Queries are defined with `query()` from `"./_generated/server"`
- [ ] Arguments are validated with `args: { fieldName: v.type() }`
- [ ] **Return values are validated with `returns:`** (locks the output shape)
- [ ] **Every public function checks `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` and verifies ownership** (use `identity.subject`, never a spoofable field like email)
- [ ] Filtered queries use `.withIndex()` instead of `.filter()` when an index exists
- [ ] `.collect()` is only used for small/bounded result sets — use `.paginate()` or `.take()` for unbounded lists (e.g., transactions)
- [ ] Never call `Date.now()` inside a query (breaks caching/reactivity) — pass time as an arg or store a status field
- [ ] `ctx.db.get/patch/replace/delete` always pass the table name first (`ctx.db.get("budgets", id)`)

### Mutations
- [ ] Mutations are defined with `mutation()` from `"./_generated/server"`
- [ ] All arguments AND return values are validated — never trust client input
- [ ] Auth + ownership are checked before any write
- [ ] Use `.patch()` for partial updates, `.replace()` for full replacements
- [ ] All promises are awaited (`await ctx.db.patch(...)`)
- [ ] Mutations return useful values (e.g., the new document's ID)

### Actions
- [ ] Actions are used ONLY for external API calls (email, payment, etc.) and use `"use node"` when they need Node APIs/SDKs
- [ ] Actions call `ctx.runMutation()` or `ctx.runQuery()` to interact with the database (never `ctx.db` directly)
- [ ] Actions schedule/call **`internal.*`** functions, never `api.*`
- [ ] Actions are NOT used for simple database operations (use mutations instead)

### Client-Side
- [ ] `ConvexProvider` wraps the app in `layout.tsx`
- [ ] `useQuery()` is only called inside `"use client"` components
- [ ] Loading states are handled (`if (!data) return <Loading />`)
- [ ] `useMutation()` functions are called in event handlers, not during render
- [ ] Error states are handled with try/catch or error boundaries

### Architecture
- [ ] Display components are separated from data-fetching components (wrapper pattern)
- [ ] Convex functions are organized by table (one file per table)
- [ ] Wrappers are thin — business logic lives in plain TS helpers (e.g. `convex/lib/auth.ts`), not inside the `query`/`mutation` body
- [ ] Repeated auth/ownership checks are extracted into a helper or custom function (`authedQuery`/`authedMutation`)
- [ ] `_generated/` folder is never manually edited
- [ ] `.env.local` contains `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` (never committed to git)
- [ ] Use `npx convex dev` while developing — never `npx convex deploy` (that's production only)

## 14. The Capstone — Reverse-Engineering a Real Feature

> Every section above taught you a concept. This section shows you ALL of them executing together inside ONE real feature of BudgetEasy.

The feature we'll reverse-engineer: **Category Allocation** — the core interaction of any zero-based budgeting app.

### What the User Sees

The user opens their June 2026 budget. At the top, a banner reads: **"$1,200 left to allocate"**. Below it, a list of categories (Groceries, Rent, Entertainment, etc.) each with an input field. The user types `400` into Groceries. Instantly, the banner updates to **"$800 left to allocate"** and the Groceries row shows `$400 / $400` (spent / allocated). Another user on a different device sees the exact same update in real time.

That one interaction exercises every single concept in this roadmap. Let's trace it.

---

### Step 1: The Contract (Law 5 — Contracts Before Code)

Before writing ANY component or backend code, define the shapes. This is what the senior architect does first.

**Database contract — `convex/schema.ts`:**
```tsx
import { defineSchema, defineTable } from "convex/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

export default defineSchema({
  budgets: defineTable({
    name: v.string(),              // "June 2026"
    totalIncome: v.number(),       // 5000
    userId: v.string(),            // who owns this budget
    createdAt: v.number(),         // timestamp
  }).index("by_user", ["userId"]),  // ← fast lookup by user

  categories: defineTable({
    budgetId: v.id("budgets"),     // ← links to a specific budget
    name: v.string(),              // "Groceries"
    allocated: v.number(),         // 400 (how much the user budgeted)
    spent: v.number(),             // 237.50 (how much actually spent)
    color: v.optional(v.string()), // "#4CAF50" for UI display
  }).index("by_budget", ["budgetId"]),  // ← fast lookup by budget
});
```

**Frontend contracts — component props:**
```tsx
// What the banner at the top needs
export interface BudgetHeaderProps {
  budgetName: string;          // "June 2026"
  totalIncome: number;         // 5000
  totalAllocated: number;      // 3800 (sum of all category allocations)
}

// What each category row needs
export interface CategoryRowProps {
  _id: Id<"categories">;       // Convex document ID
  name: string;                // "Groceries"
  allocated: number;           // 400
  spent: number;               // 237.50
  color?: string;              // "#4CAF50"
  onAllocate: (id: Id<"categories">, amount: number) => void;  // ← EVENT flows UP
}

// What the full page needs
export interface BudgetPageProps {
  budget: Budget;              // the budget document
  categories: Category[];      // all categories for this budget
}
```

**Why this matters:** These contracts are written BEFORE a single pixel exists. The AI can now generate perfect components because it knows the exact shape of every piece of data. This is Law 5 in action.

---

### Step 2: The Backend (Law 1 — Separation of Concerns)

Each Convex function has ONE job. The backend doesn't know or care about UI.

**`convex/budgets.ts` — Budget queries:**
```tsx
import { query } from "./_generated/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

// ONE JOB: Get a single budget by ID (auth + ownership enforced)
export const getById = query({
  args: { budgetId: v.id("budgets") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    if (!identity) throw new Error("Not authenticated");

    const budget = await ctx.db.get("budgets", args.budgetId);
    if (!budget || budget.userId !== identity.subject) {
      throw new Error("Not found"); // never leak another user's data
    }
    return budget;
  },
});
```

**`convex/categories.ts` — Category queries AND mutations:**
```tsx
import { query, mutation } from "./_generated/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

// ONE JOB: Get all categories for a specific budget
export const listByBudget = query({
  args: { budgetId: v.id("budgets") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Auth + ownership: confirm the caller owns the parent budget first
    const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    if (!identity) throw new Error("Not authenticated");
    const budget = await ctx.db.get("budgets", args.budgetId);
    if (!budget || budget.userId !== identity.subject) {
      throw new Error("Not found");
    }

    return await ctx.db
      .query("categories")
      .withIndex("by_budget", (q) => q.eq("budgetId", args.budgetId))
      //         ↑ uses the index from schema.ts — fast lookup
      .collect();
  },
});

// ONE JOB: Update the allocated amount for a single category
export const updateAllocation = mutation({
  args: {
    categoryId: v.id("categories"),
    newAmount: v.number(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Validate: amount cannot be negative
    if (args.newAmount < 0) {
      throw new Error("Allocation cannot be negative");
    }

    // Auth + ownership: load the category, then its budget, and confirm
    // the signed-in user owns it. Never trust the categoryId alone.
    const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    if (!identity) throw new Error("Not authenticated");
    const category = await ctx.db.get("categories", args.categoryId);
    if (!category) throw new Error("Not found");
    const budget = await ctx.db.get("budgets", category.budgetId);
    if (!budget || budget.userId !== identity.subject) {
      throw new Error("Not found");
    }

    await ctx.db.patch("categories", args.categoryId, {
      allocated: args.newAmount,
    });
    // That's it. Convex handles:
    // 1. Persisting to the database
    // 2. Notifying ALL connected clients via WebSocket
    // 3. Re-running every useQuery() that reads from "categories"
  },
});
```

**Law 1 in action:** `schema.ts` defines the shape. `budgets.ts` reads budgets. `categories.ts` reads and writes categories. Three files, three concerns. No file does more than one thing.

> **Production note:** These handlers are shown with auth + ownership checks (Non-Negotiable 2 from Section 8.10). For brevity the `returns:` validators are omitted here — but in real code add them to every function, and extract the repeated auth check into a `getCurrentUser(ctx)` / `loadOwnedBudget(ctx, id)` helper so you write it once, not in all three functions.

---

### Step 3: The Component Tree (Law 6 — Composition Over Complexity)

Don't build one `BudgetPage` monster. Build small components and snap them together.

```
BudgetPageWrapper ("use client" — fetches data from Convex)
│
├── Loading state: <BudgetSkeleton />
│
└── Data loaded:
    ├── <BudgetHeader />          ← Server-compatible, displays totals
    │     └── Shows: "June 2026 — $1,200 left to allocate"
    │
    └── <CategoryList />          ← Server-compatible, maps over array
          ├── <CategoryRow />     ← "use client", has the allocation input
          ├── <CategoryRow />     ← each row manages its own input state
          ├── <CategoryRow />
          └── <CategoryRow />
```

**4 components. Each under 60 lines. Each with ONE job.** That's Law 6.

---

### Step 4: The Display Components (Law 4 — Static by Default)

**`BudgetHeader.tsx` — Server Component (NO `"use client"`)**
```tsx
// This component has ZERO interactivity.
// It receives numbers → it renders text. That's it.
// No useState, no useEffect, no event handlers.
// Ships ZERO JavaScript to the browser.

export interface BudgetHeaderProps {
  budgetName: string;
  totalIncome: number;
  totalAllocated: number;
}

export default function BudgetHeader({
  budgetName,
  totalIncome,
  totalAllocated,
}: BudgetHeaderProps) {
  const remaining = totalIncome - totalAllocated;  // ← derived value, NOT state
  //                                                   (Law: never store derived data in state)

  return (
    <div className="bg-base-200 rounded-box p-6">
      {/* ↑ DaisyUI semantic tokens, not hardcoded colors */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-base-content">{budgetName}</h2>
      <p className="text-4xl font-extrabold mt-2">
        <span className={remaining >= 0 ? "text-success" : "text-error"}>
          {/* ↑ Conditional styling — same pattern as Pricing.tsx isPopular */}
          ${remaining.toLocaleString()}
        </span>
        <span className="text-base-content/60 text-lg ml-2">left to allocate</span>
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**What to notice:**
- `remaining` is COMPUTED inline, not stored in `useState`. It's derived from `totalIncome` and `totalAllocated`. (CONTEXT.md rule: "Never store derived data in state.")
- The component uses `text-success` and `text-error` — DaisyUI semantic tokens that automatically change with the theme. (CONTEXT.md rule: "Never use hardcoded hex colors.")
- This component has no idea whether its data came from `config.tsx` or Convex. It just receives props and renders. **That's the power of separation of concerns.**

---

### Step 5: The Interactive Component (Law 2 — Data Down, Events Up)

**`CategoryRow.tsx` — Client Component (`"use client"`)**
```tsx
"use client";
import { useState } from "react";
import { Id } from "../convex/_generated/dataModel";

export interface CategoryRowProps {
  _id: Id<"categories">;
  name: string;
  allocated: number;
  spent: number;
  color?: string;
  onAllocate: (id: Id<"categories">, amount: number) => void;
  //           ↑ EVENT flows UP — the row doesn't write to the database itself.
  //             It tells the PARENT what happened. The parent decides what to do.
}

export default function CategoryRow({
  _id,
  name,
  allocated,
  spent,
  color,
  onAllocate,
}: CategoryRowProps) {
  // Local UI state — only tracks what the user is CURRENTLY typing
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState(allocated.toString());
  //                                           ↑ initialized from the prop

  const handleBlur = () => {
    const parsed = parseFloat(inputValue);
    if (!isNaN(parsed) && parsed !== allocated) {
      onAllocate(_id, parsed);  // ← EVENT FLOWS UP to the parent
      //                           The CategoryRow does NOT call useMutation directly.
      //                           It fires an event. The parent handles the mutation.
    }
  };

  const percentUsed = allocated > 0 ? (spent / allocated) * 100 : 0;
  //                                   ↑ derived value — NOT stored in state

  return (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-4 p-4 bg-base-100 rounded-box">
      {/* Color indicator */}
      <div
        className="w-3 h-3 rounded-full"
        style={{ backgroundColor: color ?? "oklch(var(--p))" }}
        {/* ↑ The ONLY place inline style is allowed: dynamic runtime values */}
      />

      {/* Category name */}
      <span className="font-medium text-base-content flex-1">{name}</span>

      {/* Allocation input — THIS is why we need "use client" */}
      <input
        type="number"
        className="input input-bordered w-28 text-right"
        value={inputValue}
        onChange={(e) => setInputValue(e.target.value)}
        onBlur={handleBlur}           {/* ← fires event UP when user finishes typing */}
        onKeyDown={(e) => e.key === "Enter" && handleBlur()}
      />

      {/* Spent indicator */}
      <span className="text-base-content/60 w-24 text-right">
        ${spent.toLocaleString()} spent
      </span>

      {/* Progress bar */}
      <progress
        className={`progress w-32 ${
          percentUsed > 100 ? "progress-error" : "progress-primary"
          // ↑ Same conditional styling pattern as Pricing.tsx isPopular
        }`}
        value={percentUsed}
        max="100"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Law 2 dissected in this component:**
```
DATA FLOWS DOWN (props):                    EVENTS FLOW UP (callbacks):
─────────────────────────                   ────────────────────────────
Parent passes:                              Child fires:
  name="Groceries"           ──→ display      onAllocate(id, 400)  ──→ parent handles
  allocated={300}            ──→ display      (user typed 400 and hit Enter)
  spent={237.50}             ──→ display
  onAllocate={handler}       ──→ stored       Parent calls useMutation()
                                              Database updates
                                              useQuery() re-fires
                                              New props flow DOWN again
                                              ← THE FEEDBACK LOOP COMPLETES
```

**Why `CategoryRow` does NOT call `useMutation` directly:**
- It keeps the component reusable. You could reuse `CategoryRow` in a "review mode" where clicking does nothing.
- It follows Law 2 strictly. The child reports what happened. The parent decides the consequence.
- It makes testing trivial. Pass a mock `onAllocate`, assert it was called with the right values.

### Step 6: The Wrapper — Wiring It All Together (The Feedback Loop)

**`BudgetPageWrapper.tsx` — Client Component (THE ORCHESTRATOR)**
```tsx
"use client";
import { useQuery, useMutation } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "../convex/_generated/api";
import { Id } from "../convex/_generated/dataModel";
import BudgetHeader from "./BudgetHeader";
import CategoryRow from "./CategoryRow";

interface BudgetPageWrapperProps {
  budgetId: Id<"budgets">;
}

export default function BudgetPageWrapper({ budgetId }: BudgetPageWrapperProps) {
  // ─── DATA SOURCE ───────────────────────────────────────────
  // These replace "import config from '@/config'"
  // They are SUBSCRIPTIONS, not one-time fetches.
  // When ANY mutation changes budgets or categories,
  // these automatically re-run and the component re-renders.
  const budget = useQuery(api.budgets.getById, { budgetId });
  const categories = useQuery(api.categories.listByBudget, { budgetId });

  // ─── MUTATION (the write path) ─────────────────────────────
  const updateAllocation = useMutation(api.categories.updateAllocation);

  // ─── LOADING STATE ─────────────────────────────────────────
  // useQuery returns undefined while data is loading.
  // You MUST handle this. Never render with undefined data.
  if (!budget || !categories) {
    return (
      <div className="flex justify-center items-center min-h-[400px]">
        <span className="loading loading-spinner loading-lg text-primary" />
      </div>
    );
  }

  // ─── DERIVED VALUE ─────────────────────────────────────────
  // The total allocated amount is COMPUTED from the categories.
  // It is NOT stored in state. It is NOT stored in the database.
  // It is derived fresh on every render.
  const totalAllocated = categories.reduce(
    (sum, cat) => sum + cat.allocated, 0
  );

  // ─── EVENT HANDLER ─────────────────────────────────────────
  // This is the function that CategoryRow calls when the user
  // types a new allocation. The event FLOWS UP from the child,
  // and the parent HANDLES it by calling the mutation.
  const handleAllocate = async (categoryId: Id<"categories">, amount: number) => {
    // Validation: don't allow over-allocation
    const otherAllocations = categories
      .filter((c) => c._id !== categoryId)
      .reduce((sum, c) => sum + c.allocated, 0);

    if (otherAllocations + amount > budget.totalIncome) {
      alert("Cannot allocate more than your total income!");
      return;
    }

    // Fire the mutation — Convex handles the rest:
    // 1. Writes to database
    // 2. Re-runs useQuery(api.categories.listByBudget)
    // 3. categories variable updates
    // 4. totalAllocated recomputes
    // 5. BudgetHeader re-renders with new "remaining" value
    // 6. CategoryRow re-renders with new allocated value
    // ALL OF THIS HAPPENS AUTOMATICALLY. Zero manual refresh.
    await updateAllocation({ categoryId, newAmount: amount });
    //  ↑ always await your mutations so errors surface instead of vanishing
  };

  // ─── ASSEMBLY (same pattern as page.tsx) ───────────────────
  // This wrapper does the same job as page.tsx in the static app:
  // 1. Gets data (useQuery instead of config import)
  // 2. Passes data DOWN as props
  // 3. Passes event handlers DOWN as props
  return (
    <div className="max-w-3xl mx-auto p-6 space-y-4">
      {/* DATA flows DOWN — BudgetHeader receives computed values */}
      <BudgetHeader
        budgetName={budget.name}
        totalIncome={budget.totalIncome}
        totalAllocated={totalAllocated}
      />

      {/* .map() — the #1 React pattern, same as Problem.tsx steps */}
      {categories.map((category) => (
        <CategoryRow
          key={category._id}          {/* ← unique key, same as any .map() */}
          _id={category._id}
          name={category.name}
          allocated={category.allocated}
          spent={category.spent}
          color={category.color}
          onAllocate={handleAllocate}  {/* ← event handler passed DOWN */}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

### Step 7: The Page File (The Boss — Same Pattern as Always)

**`app/budget/[id]/page.tsx` — the thinnest possible file:**
```tsx
import BudgetPageWrapper from "@/components/BudgetPageWrapper";
import { Id } from "../../../convex/_generated/dataModel";

// Next.js dynamic route: /budget/k17abc... → params resolves to { id: "k17abc..." }
// IMPORTANT (Next.js 15+/16): `params` is a Promise. The page must be `async`
// and `await` it. Synchronous `params.id` access throws in Next.js 16.
export default async function BudgetPage({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ id: string }>;
}) {
  const { id } = await params;
  return (
    <main>
      <BudgetPageWrapper budgetId={id as Id<"budgets">} />
    </main>
  );
}
```

**A handful of lines of real logic.** The page does what it always does:
1. Receives (and awaits) the route parameter
2. Passes it to the component
3. Stays out of the way

Compare this to the static landing page's `page.tsx`:
```tsx
// STATIC:    <Hero {...config.hero} />
// CONVEX:    <BudgetPageWrapper budgetId={id} />   // id = await params
// Same pattern. Same thinness. Different data source.
```

### The Complete Map: Every Concept → Where It Appears

| Roadmap Concept | Where It Appears in This Feature |
|---|---|
| **Law 1: Separation of Concerns** | Schema defines shape. `categories.ts` handles data logic. `CategoryRow` handles display. `BudgetPageWrapper` handles orchestration. Four files, four concerns. |
| **Law 2: Data Down, Events Up** | `BudgetPageWrapper` passes `allocated` DOWN to `CategoryRow`. `CategoryRow` fires `onAllocate` UP. The wrapper calls the mutation. |
| **Law 3: Single Source of Truth** | The allocated amount lives in ONE place: the Convex `categories` table. Every component reads from the same source via `useQuery`. |
| **Law 4: Static by Default** | `BudgetHeader` is a Server Component — pure display, zero JS. Only `CategoryRow` (which has the input) and the wrapper (which calls hooks) are `"use client"`. |
| **Law 5: Contracts Before Code** | `BudgetHeaderProps`, `CategoryRowProps`, and the Convex schema were ALL defined before writing any rendering logic. |
| **Law 6: Composition** | 4 small components assembled in a tree. No component exceeds 80 lines. Each is testable in isolation. |
| **The Feedback Loop** | User types 400 → `onAllocate` fires → mutation writes to DB → `useQuery` re-runs → `totalAllocated` recomputes → `BudgetHeader` shows new remaining → the loop completes. |
| **TypeScript Contracts** | `CategoryRowProps` defines the exact shape. The AI knows precisely what fields exist, their types, and which are optional. |
| **Convex Schema** | `v.id("budgets")` links categories to budgets. `v.optional(v.string())` makes color optional. `.index("by_budget")` enables fast filtered queries. |
| **Convex Queries** | `listByBudget` checks auth + ownership, then uses `.withIndex()` for performance. Returns an array that the wrapper maps over. |
| **Convex Mutations** | `updateAllocation` validates input, checks auth + ownership, patches one field, and Convex auto-syncs all clients. |
| **Auth + Access Control** | Every public function calls `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` and verifies the budget belongs to `identity.subject` before reading or writing. |
| **Server vs Client** | `BudgetHeader` = Server (display). `CategoryRow` = Client (input). `BudgetPageWrapper` = Client (hooks). The page file itself has zero hooks. |
| **Wrapper Pattern** | `BudgetPageWrapper` is `"use client"` and calls `useQuery`. It passes the data as plain props to `BudgetHeader`, which can remain a server-compatible component. |
| **Derived Values** | `totalAllocated` and `percentUsed` are computed inline — never stored in state, never stored in the database. |
| **Real-Time Reactivity** | If your partner allocates $200 to Rent on their phone, your screen updates instantly. No refresh. No polling. Convex pushes the change over WebSocket. |
| **Conditional Styling** | `text-success` vs `text-error` on the remaining amount. `progress-error` vs `progress-primary` on the progress bar. Same pattern as `Pricing.tsx`'s `isPopular`. |
| **The .map() Pattern** | `categories.map(cat => <CategoryRow ... />)` — the same pattern you learned in `Problem.tsx` with steps. |
| **Loading State** | `if (!budget || !categories)` — always handle the moment before data arrives. |
| **DaisyUI Tokens** | `bg-base-200`, `text-base-content`, `input-bordered`, `progress-primary`, `loading-spinner` — zero hardcoded colors anywhere. |

Settings page? Same 6 steps.

**The pattern never changes. Only the contracts change.**

## 15. The Routing System

> Section 3 showed you *what files exist*. This section shows you *where new screens go* — the exact folder you create when you need a new page, and why. It's written as a reusable **template**: the rules are universal to any Next.js App Router project, and the examples are BudgetEasy so you can see them concretely. Copy this mental model into every project you ever build.

### 15.1 The One Rule That Explains Everything

In the Next.js App Router, **there is no routing config file.** You never register routes. Instead:

```
YOUR FOLDER STRUCTURE  ===  YOUR URL STRUCTURE
```

- A **folder** inside `app/` = a segment of the URL.
- A **`page.tsx`** inside that folder = "this URL is visitable; render this."
- Everything else (`layout.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, etc.) = special behavior for that segment.

```
app/                        →  (the root)
├── page.tsx                →  /                    (the landing page)
├── dashboard/
│   └── page.tsx            →  /dashboard
└── budget/
    └── [id]/
        └── page.tsx        →  /budget/k17abc...    (dynamic — any id)
```

> **Mental model:** The URL bar is just a path through your `app/` folders. If you can draw the folder tree, you already know every URL in your app. A folder with **no `page.tsx`** is NOT a route — it's just organization (you'll use this on purpose in 15.4).

### 15.2 The 7 Special Files (the entire App Router vocabulary)

These are the ONLY special filenames. Memorize what each does and you've memorized routing.

| File | What it does | Creates a URL? | Server/Client |
|---|---|---|---|
| `page.tsx` | The actual page content for this URL | ✅ Yes | Either |
| `layout.tsx` | Shared shell that **wraps** this segment + everything nested below it. Persists across navigation (doesn't re-render) | ❌ No | Either |
| `loading.tsx` | Instant fallback UI shown while the segment streams in (auto-wraps the page in `<Suspense>`) | ❌ No | Either |
| `error.tsx` | Error boundary for this segment — catches crashes and shows a recovery UI | ❌ No | **Client** (required) |
| `not-found.tsx` | UI shown when `notFound()` is called or a route doesn't match | ❌ No | Either |
| `route.ts` | An API endpoint (GET/POST/...) instead of a page. **Never** put `page.tsx` and `route.ts` in the same folder | ✅ Yes (API) | Server |
| `template.tsx` | Like `layout.tsx` but re-mounts on every navigation (rare — use for re-trigger animations) | ❌ No | Either |

> **The 6 you'll use daily:** `page`, `layout`, `loading`, `error`, `not-found`, and occasionally `route`. That's it.

### 15.3 The BudgetEasy Route Map (your concrete reference)

Here is the full target structure for BudgetEasy. This is the "answer key" — when you wonder "where does X go?", find the closest analog here.

```
app/
│
├── layout.tsx                 ← ROOT layout. Wraps EVERY page.
│                                 Lives here: <html>, <body>, fonts, theme,
│                                 and the <ConvexClientProvider> (see 15.6).
├── globals.css                ← design system entry (not a route)
├── page.tsx                   →  /                    Marketing landing page
├── loading.tsx                ← fallback for the whole app (optional)
├── not-found.tsx              →  shown for any unmatched URL
│
├── (marketing)/               ← ROUTE GROUP: organizes public pages.
│   │                            Parens = folder name does NOT appear in URL.
│   ├── pricing/
│   │   └── page.tsx           →  /pricing
│   └── faq/
│       └── page.tsx           →  /faq
│
├── (app)/                     ← ROUTE GROUP: the signed-in product.
│   ├── layout.tsx             ← Shared app shell (sidebar, top bar, auth gate).
│   │                            Wraps everything below — but NOT marketing.
│   │
│   ├── dashboard/
│   │   ├── page.tsx           →  /dashboard          List of all budgets
│   │   └── loading.tsx        ← skeleton while dashboard loads
│   │
│   ├── budget/
│   │   └── [id]/              ← DYNAMIC segment (one budget per id)
│   │       ├── page.tsx       →  /budget/k17abc...    The capstone feature
│   │       ├── loading.tsx    ← spinner while the budget streams
│   │       └── error.tsx      ← "Couldn't load this budget" recovery UI
│   │
│   ├── transactions/
│   │   └── page.tsx           →  /transactions       Paginated history
│   │
│   └── settings/
│       └── page.tsx           →  /settings           Theme, currency, profile
│
├── (auth)/                    ← ROUTE GROUP: sign-in flows
│   ├── login/
│   │   └── page.tsx           →  /login
│   └── signup/
│       └── page.tsx           →  /signup
│
└── api/
    └── webhooks/
        └── route.ts           →  /api/webhooks       (e.g. Stripe → action)
```

> **Why route groups?** `(marketing)`, `(app)`, and `(auth)` let you give each *area* its own `layout.tsx` (different shells) WITHOUT adding `/marketing` or `/app` to the URL. The signed-in pages share a sidebar; the marketing pages don't. That's the whole reason they exist.

### 15.4 The 5 Segment Types (everything you can name a folder)

| Folder name | Type | URL result | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dashboard/` | Static | `/dashboard` | A fixed, known page |
| `[id]/` | Dynamic | `/budget/123` (`id`=`123`) | One page template, many records (a budget, a user, a post) |
| `[...slug]/` | Catch-all | `/docs/a/b/c` (`slug`=`["a","b","c"]`) | Nested, unknown-depth paths (docs, file trees) |
| `[[...slug]]/` | Optional catch-all | matches `/shop` AND `/shop/a/b` | Same as above, but the base path also matches |
| `(group)/` | Route group | *(no URL change)* | Organize files / give an area its own layout |
| `_lib/` | Private folder | *(not routable at all)* | Co-locate helpers/components that should never be a route |

**Concrete BudgetEasy mapping:**
- `budget/[id]` → each budget is the same UI, different data. **Dynamic.**
- `(app)` → wraps every signed-in screen in one shell. **Route group.**
- `_components` inside `(app)` → screen-specific components that aren't shared globally. **Private folder.**

### 15.5 Dynamic Routes + Convex (the async params pattern)

This is the exact wiring for `app/(app)/budget/[id]/page.tsx`. It ties the URL to a Convex record. **In Next.js 15+/16, `params` is a `Promise` — the page must be `async` and `await` it** (accessing `params.id` synchronously throws):

```tsx
// app/(app)/budget/[id]/page.tsx  — a thin Server Component
import BudgetPageWrapper from "@/components/BudgetPageWrapper";
import { Id } from "@/convex/_generated/dataModel";

export default async function BudgetPage({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ id: string }>;   // ← Promise, not a plain object
}) {
  const { id } = await params;        // ← unwrap before use
  return <BudgetPageWrapper budgetId={id as Id<"budgets">} />;
}
```

The page stays thin (Server Component). The `"use client"` wrapper does the `useQuery`/`useMutation` work — exactly the pattern from Section 14.

> **searchParams too:** `/transactions?month=06` is read the same way — `searchParams` is also a `Promise<{ month?: string }>` you `await`. Use **dynamic segments** (`[id]`) for *which record*, and **search params** (`?month=06`) for *filters/sorting* on a list.

### 15.6 Layouts — The Nesting System (and where Convex plugs in)

Layouts wrap pages and **nest**. The root layout wraps a section layout, which wraps the page. They persist across navigation (a sidebar doesn't flicker when you click between budgets).

```
<RootLayout>              app/layout.tsx        ← html, body, theme, fonts, Convex provider
  <AppLayout>            app/(app)/layout.tsx   ← sidebar + auth gate
    <BudgetPage />       app/(app)/budget/[id]/page.tsx
  </AppLayout>
</RootLayout>
```

The **root layout is where `ConvexClientProvider` lives** — once, at the top, so every page below can call `useQuery`/`useMutation` (Section 8.7):

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
import ConvexClientProvider from "./ConvexClientProvider";

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html data-theme="synthwave">
      <body>
        <ConvexClientProvider>{children}</ConvexClientProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

A **nested layout** is where shared, area-specific UI goes — e.g. the app sidebar that should appear on `/dashboard`, `/budget/[id]`, and `/settings` but NOT on the marketing pages:

```tsx
// app/(app)/layout.tsx — wraps only the signed-in product
export default function AppLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div className="flex">
      <Sidebar />                         {/* shown on every (app) page */}
      <main className="flex-1">{children}</main>
    </div>
  );
}
```

> **Rule:** If a piece of UI should appear on several pages of one area, it belongs in that area's `layout.tsx` — not copy-pasted into each `page.tsx`. (Law 3: Single Source of Truth, applied to layout.)

### 15.7 `loading.tsx` & `error.tsx` — Two States You Get For Free

These map directly onto the data states you already handle in Convex:

| File | Handles | Relationship to Convex |
|---|---|---|
| `loading.tsx` | The **route** loading (navigation + server streaming) | Complements `useQuery() === undefined`. The route-level file covers the page shell; the `if (!data) return <Loading />` inside your client wrapper covers the live data. |
| `error.tsx` | A **crash** in the segment (thrown error) | Catches errors thrown by your Convex functions (e.g. `throw new Error("Not authenticated")`) so the user sees a recovery UI instead of a white screen. |

```tsx
// app/(app)/budget/[id]/loading.tsx — instant, no props, shows during navigation
export default function Loading() {
  return (
    <div className="flex justify-center items-center min-h-[400px]">
      <span className="loading loading-spinner loading-lg text-primary" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

```tsx
// app/(app)/budget/[id]/error.tsx — MUST be a Client Component
"use client";
export default function Error({ reset }: { error: Error; reset: () => void }) {
  return (
    <div className="text-center p-10">
      <p className="text-error font-semibold">Couldn't load this budget.</p>
      <button className="btn btn-primary mt-4" onClick={reset}>Try again</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 15.8 Navigating Between Routes

| Need | Use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| A link the user clicks | `<Link>` (never `<a>` for internal links) | `<Link href={`/budget/${id}`}>Open</Link>` |
| Navigate from code (after a mutation) | `useRouter()` (Client Component only) | `router.push("/dashboard")` |
| Send a 404 from a page/function | `notFound()` | `if (!budget) notFound();` |

```tsx
"use client";
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";   // ← App Router import, NOT "next/router"

const router = useRouter();
const create = useMutation(api.budgets.create);

async function handleCreate() {
  const id = await create({ name: "July 2026" });
  router.push(`/budget/${id}`);   // jump straight to the new budget
}
```

### 15.9 Protecting Routes (where auth lives)

Two layers, used together:

1. **Server gate (`middleware.ts` at the project root)** — redirects unauthenticated users away from `(app)` routes before the page even renders. This is your perimeter.
2. **Function gate (Convex)** — every query/mutation still checks `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` (Section 8.10). **Never rely on routing alone for security** — the middleware improves UX, but the Convex auth check is what actually protects the data.

```ts
// middleware.ts (root) — pseudocode shape; exact API depends on your auth provider
export function middleware(request) {
  const isSignedIn = /* read auth cookie/token */;
  const isProtected = request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith("/dashboard")
    || request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith("/budget");
  if (isProtected && !isSignedIn) {
    return Response.redirect(new URL("/login", request.url));
  }
}
```

> Auth-provider tip: Clerk and Auth0 ship Next.js middleware helpers that do this for you. Whatever you use, the rule holds: **route protection is UX; the Convex `ctx.auth` check is the real lock.**

### 15.10 The Routing Decision Template (use this every time)

When you need a new screen, walk this tree:

```
I need a new screen. Where does it go?
│
├── Is it a page users visit, or an API endpoint?
│   ├── API endpoint → app/api/<name>/route.ts
│   └── Page → keep going ↓
│
├── Is it public (marketing) or signed-in (product)?
│   ├── Public → app/(marketing)/<name>/page.tsx
│   ├── Auth flow → app/(auth)/<name>/page.tsx
│   └── Signed-in → app/(app)/<name>/page.tsx
│
├── Is there ONE of it, or one PER record?
│   ├── One fixed page (e.g. /settings) → <name>/page.tsx
│   └── One per record (e.g. a budget)  → <name>/[id]/page.tsx  (async params!)
│
├── Does it need live data?
│   └── YES → thin page.tsx → "use client" wrapper (useQuery) → display components
│            (the Section 14 pattern)
│
└── Does it share UI with sibling pages (sidebar, tabs)?
    └── YES → put that UI in the area's layout.tsx, not each page
```

Then add, as needed:
- `loading.tsx` if the data takes a beat to load
- `error.tsx` if a thrown error should show a recovery UI (not a crash)

### 15.11 The Universal Template (copy this into any project)

Blank scaffold on the left, the BudgetEasy fill-in on the right. Rename the placeholders and you have a new app's routing in minutes.

```

middleware.ts  (route protection)     middleware.ts  (guards /dashboard, /budget)
```

**The four laws of routing (they never change):**
1. **Folders are URLs; `page.tsx` makes a folder visitable.** No config files.
2. **Group with `( )`, parametrize with `[ ]`, hide with `_`.**
3. **Shared UI goes in `layout.tsx`; per-record UI goes in `[id]/page.tsx`.**
4. **Pages stay thin** — they read the route param, hand it to a wrapper, and get out of the way (Section 14, Step 7).

## Final Words

You don't need to be a React expert to build with AI. You need to be an **architect** who understands:

1. **Where does data live?** → Config, Convex database, or API
2. **How does data move?** → Props down, events up, `useQuery()` subscribes, `useMutation()` writes
3. **Who is responsible for what?** → One job per component, one job per Convex function
4. **When is JS needed?** → Only for interactivity and live data
5. **What shape is the data?** → TypeScript contracts on the frontend, `v.` validators on the backend

Master these 5 questions. The AI handles the rest. That's the 10x.
